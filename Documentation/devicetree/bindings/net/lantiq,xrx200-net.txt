Lantiq xRX200 PMAC Ethernet driver
==================================

Required properties:

- compatible	: "lantiq,xrx200-net" for the PMAC of the embedded
		: GSWIP in the xXR200
- reg		: memory range of the PMAC core inside of the GSWIP core
- interrupts	: TX and RX DMA interrupts. Use interrupt-names "tx" for 
		: the TX interrupt and "rx" for the RX interrupt.

Optional properties:

- lantiq,phys	: A list of phandles of the FW loader of the embedded
		  Ethernet PHYs phys. This is used to make sure the
		  firmware is loaded into the embedded PHY before this
		  driver is loaded and accesses them over the MDIO bus.

Example:

eth0: eth@E10B308 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "lantiq,xrx200-net";
	reg = <0xE10B308 0x30>;
	interrupts = <73>, <72>;
	interrupt-names = "tx", "rx";
	lantiq,phys = <&gphy0>, <&gphy1>;
};
